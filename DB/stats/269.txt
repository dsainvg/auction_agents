BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A rising star from Delhi’s cricketing circuit, Arya made a name for
  himself as a six-hitting machine while leading the Delhi U19 side. The
  stylish left-handed batter impressed with a gritty 71 on his first-class
  debut for Delhi in the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy against Tamil Nadu. He later
  announced his arrival in T20 cricket with a blistering 102 off 46 balls
  against Uttar Pradesh in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, showcasing his
  explosive stroke play. His talent was first spotted in local leagues, where
  he dominated with consistent big-hitting performances, racking up runs at a
  staggering strike rate and smashing record-breaking sixes. This caught the
  attention of IPL scouts, and ahead of the TATA IPL 2025, Punjab Kings
  secured him for INR 1 crore. Now set to feature on the biggest stage, Arya
  will have the opportunity to learn from stalwarts like captain Shreyas Iyer,
  coach Ricky Ponting, and Glenn Maxwell, an experience that will be
  invaluable in shaping his future.
