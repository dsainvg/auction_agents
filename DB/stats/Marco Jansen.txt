BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Hailing from South Africa, Marco Jansen is your quintessential utility
  player. An all-rounder, Jansen can generate pace, bounce and swing. And he
  can provide blustering knocks in the lower-middle order. The South African
  all-rounder starred in the 2020 U19 World Cup for the Proteas, taking 10
  wickets and scoring 111 runs as the hosts reached the quarterfinals. He has
  since then been a key figure in the South African bowling attack. The tall
  left-handed pacer’s ability to extract pace and bounce makes him a lethal
  option with the ball, and he can hit the ball clean, making him a dangerous
  prospect in the lower-middle order. Jansen made his Test debut against India
  in the Boxing Day Test in 2021, and became the first player born in the
  2000s to be capped for the national side. He made his IPL debut for Mumbai
  Indians against RCB in the 2021 edition and made his mark by dismissing
  Virat Kohli. Jansen was part of the Sunrisers Hyderabad from 2022-24 and
  made valuable contributions with both bat and ball. In the year 2025, Jansen
  will be seen wearing the Punjab Kings jersey in the IPL, after being
  acquired by the franchise for INR 7 Crore. As Punjab chase their maiden IPL
  title in 2025, Jansen’s lethal bounce, swing, and lower-order hitting will
  be key to their campaign.
