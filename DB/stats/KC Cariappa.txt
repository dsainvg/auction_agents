BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mystery spinner KC Cariappa rose to fame because of innumerable
  variations in his bowling skill set and ability to bamboozle batsmen with
  his spin acumen. He made his debut with the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2015,
  and later was a part of the Kings XI Punjab set up. He did not have the best
  of IPLs picking up just 8 wickets in 10 matches across three seasons. He was
  roped in as one of the replacements for injured pacers Kamlesh Nagarkoti &
  Shivam Mavi in 2019. KC Cariappa will ply his trade for RR after being
  brought on board for INR 20 Lac in the IPL 2021 Player Auction. The
  leg-spinner has thus far played 29 T20s and has 25 wickets to his name and
  will be out to make an impact for RR in the IPL 2021.
