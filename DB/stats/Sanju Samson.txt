BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Sanju Samson came into reckoning with his gritty knocks for Rajasthan
  Royals in his debut season for the franchise. The wicketkeeper-batter from
  Kerala was groomed by Rahul Dravid into a tough campaigner. He joined the
  Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) squad in 2016 and played some crucial
  innings for the team during his two seasons with them before moving back to
  Rajasthan Royals. Sanju scored 342 runs in IPL 2019 and then followed it up
  with 375 runs in the IPL 2020. He was moved into a senior position when
  named captain for the 2021 season. He led from the front in that season and
  finished as RR's highest run-getter with 484 runs from 14 innings. He
  continued his good form in the 2022 edition, helping the Royals reach the
  final, scoring 458 runs at an average of 28.62 (third-highest run-getter for
  RR). The consistency continued in 2023 with 362 runs at a healthy SR of
  153.38. He continued his rich run of form by scoring 531 runs in IPL 2024
  and led them to the playoffs yet again in that edition. Retained by
  Rajasthan Royals ahead of IPL 2025, Sanju will look to continue to lead from
  the front and bring Rajasthan their second IPL trophy.
