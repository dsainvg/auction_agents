BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A bowling all-rounder from Haryana, Jayant Yadav is known for his tight
  off-spin and his ability to contribute useful lower-order runs. With over
  250 first-class wickets and nearly 3,000 runs, he has been a key figure in
  domestic cricket. His ability to contain runs and bowl effectively in the
  powerplay makes him a valuable asset in T20 cricket. After spending five
  seasons with Delhi Capitals (2014-2018), he became a two-time IPL champion
  with Mumbai Indians (2019, 2020), playing a crucial role in the IPL 2020
  final by dismissing Shikhar Dhawan. He later joined Gujarat Titans in 2022,
  winning the title with them. The franchise retained their trust in him,
  re-signing him for INR 75 Lakh at the 2025 TATA IPL Auction.
