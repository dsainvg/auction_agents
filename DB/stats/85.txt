BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Faf Du Plessis will also once again don the yellow of Chennai Super Kings
  colours after they used the Right to Match card for him. KXIP bought him for
  Rs 1.6 Cr but CSK trumped them by using their RTM card and it is a bargain.
  While the classy and composed batsman did not get many outings in the RPS
  squad where he was picked up in the IPL player draft, du Plessis has had
  consistent performances for CSK wherein he went on to have a very successful
  debut season scoring 398 runs. He impressed with a half-century on his ODI
  debut, against India and soon enough, found himself in South Africa’s squad
  for the 2011 World Cup. With a century on Test debut against Australia, du
  Plessis has shed the tag of a limited-overs specialist. Although batting
  remains his area of prowess, du Plessis can come up with a few handy
  leg-spinners when required. To boot that, he is a livewire in the field,
  hence, making him a perfect T20 package for any captain.
