BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Able to bowl at 140 kmph-plus on a consistent basis, Rasikh Dar had a
  breakthrough TATA IPL season in 2024, five years after he made his debut in
  the league playing for Mumbai Indians. He also represented Kolkata Knight
  Riders in 2022, before being picked up by Delhi Capitals ahead of the 2024
  season, during which he took nine wickets in eight games, including
  three-fers against Gujarat Titans and his former team, Mumbai Indians.
  Having been considered an up-and-coming pace bowling star for years, Dar’s
  impressive run in the 2024 season meant that the Royal Challengers Bengaluru
  (RCB) were confident enough in his potential, spending INR 6 Crore to
  acquire his services for TATA IPL 2025.
