### Personal Details

- Full Name Billy James Stanlake

- Age 31

- Date of Birth 04 November 1994

- Birthplace Hervey Bay, Queensland

- Height 204cm

- Batting Style Left Handed Bat

- Bowling Style Right-Arm Fast Seam

The tallest man to play professional cricket for Australia, Billy Stanlake towers at 204cm, combining an extraordinary release height and bounce with fearsome pace.... He was a surprise call-up to Australia's ODI squad in January 2017 to play Pakistan, playing two matches, and made his T20 international debut the same summer against Sri Lanka.

But his early career was blighted by a series of injuries, most notably a toe infection that almost saw the digit amputated ahead of the 2017-18 summer.... Lured away from Queensland by the Adelaide Strikers for the KFC Big Bash League, Stanlake continued to rise in prominence, and returned to Australia colours in January 2018 in a T20 tri-series against New Zealand and England. Stanlake played 18 T20Is in 2018 but an ankle injury halted his momentum.... He was traded to the Melbourne Stars in exchange for Daniel Worrall and would play 12 matches for his new club in BBL|10.

With another back stress fracture behind him, Stanlake made the move to Tasmania and the Hobart Hurricanes ahead of the 2022-23 season and featured seven times for the 'Canes in their drought-breaking title win in BBL|14.... Stanlake was named in Australia A's squad to face Sri Lanka A in the middle of 2025.... |MatchesM|Innings BattedInn|Runs ScoredRuns|Highest ScoreHS|Batting AverageAvg|50s Scored50s|100s Scored100s|Strike RateSR|Not OutsNO|4s Hit4s|6s Hit6s|CatchesCt|StumpingsSt|... |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
