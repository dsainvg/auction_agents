BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The right-arm fast-medium bowling all-rounder from Guyana broke onto the
  scene known more for his exploits with the ball in hand, but his batting
  prowess as a finisher in the lower middle-order has earned him great praise
  over the years. A case in point is the TATA IPL 2024 season, during which he
  lit up the Wankhede Stadium while playing for Mumbai Indians against Delhi
  Capitals, smashing 32 runs including four sixes and two fours in a single
  over off Anrich Nortje. After more than 40 T20Is for the West Indies,
  Shepherd has a bowling average of below 28 and a batting strike rate of
  almost 140, thus showing what he brings to the table. A highly effective
  utility player who can win matches on his own, Shepherd was acquired by
  Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) for his base price of INR 1.5 Crore ahead
  of TATA IPL 2025.
