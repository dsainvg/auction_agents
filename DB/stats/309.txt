BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The hard-hitting Sarfaraz Khan became the youngest to be picked up by a
  franchise in the 2015 IPL Auction by Royal Challengers Bangalore and spent
  four seasons under the tutelage of Virat Kohli, where he managed to make a
  mark with his unique batting. Sarfaraz has the experience of playing against
  opposition on pitches across the world thanks to exposure at the Under-19
  level. After making a switch from Mumbai to Uttar Pradesh in domestic
  cricket and then back to Mumbai, Sarfaraz is looking to revive his T20
  standing. He was picked up by PBKS for INR 25 lakhs at the player auctions
  prior to IPL 2019 and was retained ahead of the 2020 season. In 2019, he
  played 8 games and made 180 runs. Sarfaraz is highly talented and he has it
  in him to get that one big knock which will pitchfork him into prominence.
  2020 was an average season for the righthander but he will be keeping his
  hopes alive and back his abilities to support the PBKS batting in the 14th
  edition with his unorthodox shots.
