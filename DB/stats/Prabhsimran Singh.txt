BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Prabhsimran Singh - the Patiala-based wicketkeeper-batter – initially
  made waves in Punjab’s age-group cricket, leading the state’s U19 side and
  smashing a record-breaking 298 off 301 balls in the 2018-19 Cooch Behar
  Trophy. He made his first-class debut for Punjab in the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy
  and has made some promising contributions since then. The year 2024 was a
  defining one for Prabhsimran as he hammered 404 runs in the 2024-25 Syed
  Mushtaq Ali Trophy at a strike rate of 163.56, including an unbeaten 106*
  off 53 against Meghalaya, reinforcing his reputation as a top-order dynamo.
  The explosive wicketkeeper-batter first burst onto the IPL scene when Punjab
  Kings (then Kings XI Punjab) signed him at the 2019 auction, a bold
  investment in the then-18-year-old. His IPL breakthrough came in 2023, when
  he smashed 358 runs in 14 matches, including a stunning 103 off 65 balls
  against Delhi Capitals, the second IPL ton by a PBKS batter, vindicating the
  franchise’s faith. Retained ahead of 2024, he added 334 runs at a strike
  rate of 156.80, with a match-defining 71 off 34 against Sunrisers Hyderabad.
  He was one of only two players retained by PBKS ahead of the IPL 2025
  season, cementing his status as a core member. Prabhsimran brings his 1,424
  IPL runs (strike rate 145.16), explosive batting and reliable glovework to
  PBKS, with the franchise banking on his power-hitting and aggression to
  ignite their campaign.
