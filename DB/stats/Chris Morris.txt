BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The South Africa all-rounder was one of the top buys at the IPL 2020
  Player Auction when he was sold to the RCB for a whooping INR 10 cr. In
  2019, Chris Morris was one of the players retained by the Daredevils ahead
  of the 2019 auction. The South African with a ‘never say die’ attitude has
  played a key role in Delhi's campaigns over the last few seasons, starring
  with both bat and ball. After beginning his IPL journey with Chennai Super
  Kings, and being part of the Rajasthan Royals, Morris found stable ground in
  the form of Delhi Capitals, thanks to his ability to bowl yorkers in the
  death overs, and being able to clear the boundary as a finisher. Morris will
  now play an important role for the Challengers as one of their experienced
  overseas players. RR won the fierce the bidding war during the player
  auction ahead of the IPL 2021 and brought Morris on board for a whopping sum
  of INR 16.25 Cr, making him the most expensive player bought in the
  tournament history. The South African all-rounder was with the Royal
  Challengers Bangalore in the IPL 2020 and despite missing the initial part
  of the season, he made his presence felt with the ball, scalping 11 wickets
  from 9 games. While he has shifted base from RCB to RR, Morris will be out
  to live up to the expectations and set the stage on fire for RR. Chris
  Morris was sold to Rajasthan Royals for a whopping sum of INR 16.25 Cr &
  became the most expensive player bought in the IPL Auction history.
