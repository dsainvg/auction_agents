BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A product of Punjab’s cricketing system, Nehal Wadhera is a bright
  left-handed batter with immense quality and skill set. He has the ability to
  produce excellent cricketing shots and adds the left-handed elegance to make
  them even more gorgeous. He made his first-class debut for Punjab in the
  2022-23 Ranji Trophy, scoring 123 on debut against Gujarat, and had earlier
  debuted in T20s during the 2020-21 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Wadhera smashed
  251 runs in the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at a strike rate of 153.04,
  including a match-winning 68* off 34 against Bengal, helping Punjab reach
  the semifinals. His IPL journey began in 2023 with MI, where he scored 241
  runs in 10 matches at a strike rate of 145.18, including two fifties, with a
  standout 64 off 51 against Gujarat Titans. Retained for 2024, he added 109
  runs in 6 games, highlighted by a pressure-relieving 49 off 24 against
  Rajasthan Royals. Punjab Kings swooped in at the IPL 2025 mega-auction,
  securing him for INR 4.2 Crore after a bidding war with Chennai Super Kings
  and Gujarat Titans, marking a homecoming for the local lad. Wadhera joins
  PBKS as a key middle-order enforcer, with the franchise banking on his 350
  IPL runs (strike rate 140) and fearless approach to bolster their batting
  under Shreyas Iyer’s leadership.
