Raised in the small town of Snug in southern Tasmania, Webster burst into state ranks with dominant performances in the Tasmanian Premier League.... A prospective AFL draftee, Webster played for the Tassie Mariners at the under-18 level before choosing the cricket path. At only 20, Webster amassed 677 runs at 45.13 for his local side Kingborough and was awarded a Tigers rookie contract in 2013-14.

After impressing with 494 runs including two centuries in his first full Sheffield Shield season in 2015-16, Webster's watershed moment came in the Covid winter of 2020 when he shifted from a part-time off-spinner to a fully-fledged pace-bowling allrounder.... Four years later, the right-hander produced one of the greatest individual Shield seasons of all-time to lead the Tigers back to the final after a fifth-placed finish the season prior.

Webster's 938 runs, 30 wickets and 24 catches in 2023-24 saw him become just the second player to score 900 runs and take 30 wickets in the Shield's 131-year history (after Garry Sobers' 973 runs and 47 wickets for South Australia in 1963-64).... Webster was called up for his Test debut in the fifth and final Test of the blockbuster 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, handed Baggy Green No.469 by Australian great Mark Waugh at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He delivered with a vital half-century in Australia's win. He was also Australia's best performer with the bat at the ICC World Test Championship Final against South Africa in 2025.... |MatchesM|Innings BattedInn|Runs ScoredRuns|Highest ScoreHS|Batting AverageAvg|50s Scored50s|100s Scored100s|Strike RateSR|Not OutsNO|4s Hit4s|6s Hit6s|CatchesCt|StumpingsSt|... |--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
