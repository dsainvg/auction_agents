BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A hard-hitting opening batsman, Jason Roy burst into international
  cricket with a lot of potential when he made his T20I debut against India in
  2014. From 2015, he established himself as a vital cog in England’s
  limited-overs plans, helping them off to good and quick starts consistently.
  Roy went on to become invaluable to England’s cause and was a vital part of
  their 2019 World Cup victory.A powerful hitter, he likes to dominate the
  bowling upfront as a strike-rate over 140 in T20 cricket suggests. He made
  his IPL debut in 2017 while playing for the Gujarat Lions. In 2018, he was
  picked by the Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals). His most memorable
  moment in the IPL came against the Mumbai Indians, when he led his team with
  a belligerent 91 not out to help Delhi successfully chase down a target of
  195. He was drafted into Sunrisers as replacement player for Mitchell Marsh.
