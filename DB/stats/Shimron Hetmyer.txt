  Hetmyer scored 314 runs at an average of 44.86 and SR of 153.92 in a season
  where RR reached the final. The 2023 season saw him continue his good work
  as he amassed 299 runs at a healthy average of 37.37 and SR Of 151.77. He is
  now an integral member of the RR squad and was bought by the franchise for
  INR 11 Crore ahead of IPL 2025. With his aggressive batting and finishing
  abilities, Hetmyer will once again be the vital cog for RR and expectations
  from him will remain high.
