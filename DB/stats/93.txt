In the same tour, Mendis made his Twenty20 International (T20I) debut for Sri Lanka against England on 5 July 2016.... ### Making a mark in the international arena (2016–2018)

On 28 July 2016, Mendis scored his maiden Test century during the first Test against Australia at the Pallekele Cricket Stadium. He became the youngest Sri Lankan to score a century against Australia and also the highest score against Australia on home soil. Sri Lanka won the match by 106 runs, which was only their second Test win against Australia. Mendis won the Man of the Match award for his performance.... In the fifth match of the Tri-series in Zimbabwe against the West Indies, Mendis scored match-winning 94 runs and made 94-run partnership with Niroshan Dickwella. Sri Lanka later posted 330 runs off 50 overs, which was recorded as the highest total by Sri Lanka against the West Indies....

On 28 March 2017, in the second ODI against Bangladesh, Mendis scored his maiden ODI century, with 102 runs. However, the match ended with a no result, due to heavy rain.... On 8 June 2017, against India in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, Mendis scored a match-winning 89 runs and made a 159-run stand for the second wicket with Danushka Gunathilaka. In the match, Sri Lanka chased 321 runs scored by India, by recording the highest successful run chase in Champion's Trophy history....

After good performances in Tests against Bangladesh, Mendis was named to the T20I squad for Sri Lanka by replacing injured Kusal Perera. In the first match, he scored a match-winning knock of 53 from 27 balls. Bangladesh scored 193 in their 20 overs, which was then their highest T20I total....

In May 2018, he was one of 33 cricketers to be awarded a national contract by Sri Lanka Cricket ahead of the 2018–19 season.... ### Ups and downs (2018-2020)

Mendis was totally out of form during the 2018 Asia Cup, where he was dismissed for naught in both games against Bangladesh and Afghanistan. His place in the team was in doubt with poor performances, and he was omitted from the England tour in Sri Lanka. But during the ODI series, Mendis was called into the squad for the remainder of the series against England, as a replacement for Kusal Perera, who suffered a quad strain in the second ODI....

The partnership of 246, was also Sri Lanka's highest for any wicket against New Zealand and also Sri Lanka's highest in the second innings of a Test. It was the first time a Sri Lankan pair had added 200-plus runs in the second innings of a Test outside Asia.... In the second Test, Mendis reached 1,000 Test runs in the calendar year 2018. He became only the second player after Virat Kohli to achieve the feat. He finished 2018 as the second-highest run-scorer in Test cricket, with 1,023 runs at an average of 46.50, including three centuries and four fifties.... During the two-match Test series against South Africa, Mendis continued his poor form with the bat with scores 0, 12 and 16. However, his fielding efforts at slip improved in each innings. In the second innings of the second test at Port Elizabeth, Mendis scored his 9th test fifty and put on an unbeaten partnership of 163 runs off 213 balls with newcomer Oshada Fernando to win the match by 8 wickets....

On 25 February 2020, against the West Indies, Mendis scored his second ODI century. Along with Avishka Fernando, they made a 239-run partnership for the third wicket, with Sri Lanka eventually making 345/8. West Indies collapsed in the chase and Sri Lanka won the match by 161 runs. This was the biggest win in terms of runs against the West Indies by Sri Lanka in ODIs, with Sri Lanka taking an unassailable lead in the series.... ### International ban (2021)

On 28 June 2021, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) suspended Mendis, Danushka Gunathilaka and Niroshan Dickwella after they breached the team's bio-secure bubble during Sri Lanka's tour of England.
