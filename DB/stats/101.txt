BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka in 2012 to
  try his luck at a fast-bowler’s camp, after he had impressed in an Under-17
  tournament in his hometown Satkhira. He was admitted to the Bangladesh
  Cricket Board's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to
  make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. He initially
  lacked pace, but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he
  took 26 wickets. An international call up came soon and Mustafizur impressed
  straightaway making some of the best in the business look tentative against
  him. He enjoyed great success against India in the Asia Cup in 2016 and
  caught the eye worldwide for his ability to generate good pace and for his
  deceptive slower one. The IPL 2016 was his first stint with the IPL and he
  was known for his lethal yorker to KKR all-rounder Andre Russell. He was
  impressive for SRH last year and would be looking to do well in the 2017
  edition as well. RR acquired Mustafizur's services after bringing him on the
  board for INR 1 Cr. The left-arm pacer from Bangladesh has thus far played
  three IPL seasons and has 24 IPL wickets to his name and he will be looking
  to add a few more wickets to his tally as RR look to clinch the IPL 2021
  title.

He has taken more wickets in the death overs of Twenty20 Internationals than any other bowler.

Making his debut for the Bangladesh national team in 2015, Mustafizur Rahman showcased his skills in the limited-overs formats. Mustafizur's international career highlights includes his debut series against India in 2015, where he became the first player to claim 11 wickets in his first two one day international matches.... This achievement propelled Bangladesh to a historic series victory over India.

"Mustafizur has a God-gifted slow ball."

— Ashish Nehra

Mustafizur achieved success in the beginning of his international career by bowling off cutters, a type of bowling which moves away (from the right-hander) in the off direction, of the pitch. Mustafizur stated on a press conference in June 2015 that he first discovered the technique after his fellow cricketer, Anamul Haque insisted him to bowl a slower delivery. According to former Indian cricketer Maninder Singh, his slower balls are difficult to read.... ## Personal life

Mustafizur grew up in the small town of Satkhira in Khulna, Bangladesh. He is the youngest of Abul Qasem Gazi and Mahmuda Khatun's six children. His father is an enthusiastic fan of cricket. Mustafizur's interest in cricket rose when he started practicing the game at a location that was 40 kilometres (25 mi) away from home every morning, with his brother Mokhlesur Rahman. This affected his education as he occasionally missed school to play cricket.... Prior to discovering his bowling talents, Mustafizur played as a batsman with a tennis ball. According to him, he took inspiration from Pakistani pacer Mohammad Amir who is his idol.... On 15 March 2019, along with several members of the Bangladesh test team, he was moments from entering the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, when a terrorist attack began. All members of the team were "deeply affected". Mustafizur went on to get married on 22 March.
