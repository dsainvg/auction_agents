BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of the brightest young talents in Indian cricket, Shubman Gill is a
  right-handed opening batter with immense promise. The Punjab-born batter
  shot to fame as the vice-captain of India’s U19 World Cup-winning team in
  2018, where he was the team’s top run-scorer. After a stellar start with KKR
  from 2018 to 2021, where he was their highest run-scorer in 2020 and 2021,
  Gill moved to Gujarat Titans in 2022. His pivotal contributions helped GT
  win the IPL 2022 title, and he followed that with a record-breaking IPL 2023
  season, where he scored 890 runs with four centuries. Gill’s leadership
  skills were also evident in IPL 2024 when he captained GT. He continues to
  thrive for India, with centuries across all formats and played a crucial
  role in India's 2025 Champions Trophy victory. GT retained him as their
  captain for TATA IPL 2025.
