BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The versatile right-arm pacer Vyshak Vijaykumar is a product of
  Karnataka’s robust domestic system, and made waves in his early career,
  leading the Karnataka U-16 side with a century as a batter before
  transitioning into a medium-pace bowler. He made his first-class debut in
  the 2021-22 Ranji Trophy, followed by his T20 debut in the Syed Mushtaq Ali
  Trophy in 2021. His IPL debut came for Royal Challengers Bengaluru against
  Delhi Capitals in 2023, where he announced himself with an impressive spell
  of 3/20, finishing the season with 9 wickets in 7 matches. Retained by RCB
  for 2024, he picked up 4 wickets in 4 games, showcasing his knack for
  variations and slower balls despite limited opportunities. His domestic form
  carried into the 2024-25 season, where he continued to impress with 103
  first-class wickets to his name by then. Punjab Kings recognized his growing
  stature, securing him for INR 1.80 Crore at the IPL 2025 mega auction.
  Vyshak joins PBKS as a key player in their pace attack, with the franchise
  banking on his ability to deliver breakthroughs in the powerplay and slog
  overs. His experience on Indian pitches will make him a vital asset as
  Punjab Kings aim for their first IPL title in 2025.
