BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Mumbai Indians showed confidence in this skilful leg spinner and gave him
  13 of the 16 matches they played in 2019. There is no dearth of talent in
  him and he surely proved that in the 2020 season scalping 15 wickets, not
  letting the batsmen get away with his clever googlies. Captain Rohit Sharma
  had used him in the powerplay and he proved that he could do the difficult
  job too. It will not be surprising if he gets to bowl in the first six overs
  again
