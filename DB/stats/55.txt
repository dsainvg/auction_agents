BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A leg-spinner from Uttar Pradesh, Karn Sharma made headlines in IPL 2014
  when Sunrisers Hyderabad bought him for INR 3.75 cr to in the IPL Auction.
  It was the highest amount earned by a domestic uncapped player in the
  auction and was a reward for his performance with SRH when he grabbed 11
  wickets in 13 games at an economy rate of 6.60. With 15 wickets in 2014
  season, the old-fashioned leggie started playing a vital role in the team’
  spin bowling options. Karn was bought by Mumbai Indians in the 2017 edition
  of the league and they tried hard to bring him back, but CSK outbid them and
  landed the star spinner for INR 5 Cr.
