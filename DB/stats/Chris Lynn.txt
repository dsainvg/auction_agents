BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Kolkata Knight Riders’ loss is Mumbai Indians’ gain as the explosive
  opening batsman joined the defending champions in the 2020 season. If Mumbai
  Indians are looking for some firepower at the top, they now have plenty with
  Rohit Sharma, Quinton de Kock and Lynn providing some terrific options.
  Picked at his base price of INR 2 crore at the auction ahead of the 2020
  season, the righthander didn’t feature in the playing XI because MI had well
  established openers throughout the 13th edition, in form of Rohit Sharma and
  Quinton de Kock. Lynn had an impressive 12th season scoring 405 runs from 13
  games with an average of 31.15 including four half centuries. He is known to
  strike big and when he gets going, the bowling side is put under tremendous
  pressure. If Lynn is successful at the top, the pressure will be off MI’s
  middle and lower-middle order and one can expect high totals from them
  considering many all-rounders they have in the side. He is certainly an
  exciting pick and it allows MI to try out different combinations.
