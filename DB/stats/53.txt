BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The crafty left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar hails from Moga, Punjab. He has
  already showcased his potential in the state’s domestic setup, leading
  Punjab U23 to the CK Nayudu Trophy title in 2018-19 with 28 wickets,
  including a match-winning 6/54 against Karnataka. He made his first-class
  debut in the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy and debuted in T20s during the 2017-18
  Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, blending tight lines with handy lower-order
  batting. This helped him earn a spot in the IPL when he was picked by the
  Punjab Kings (then Kings XI Punjab) in the 2019 edition. His best
  performance came in 2021 when he picked up 3 for 19 against Royal
  Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). He dismissed Virat Kohli for his maiden IPL
  wicket and also went on to dismiss Glenn Maxwell and AB de Villiers. Brar
  became a regular in the squad in the 2023 and 2024 seasons, picking up 16
  wickets in those two seasons overall. Showing faith in his abilities, PBKS
  acquired his services for INR 1.5 Crore. His orthodox left-arm spin will be
  crucial in the middle overs for the Punjab Kings as he adds immense value in
  captain Shreyas Iyer’s bowling arsenal.
