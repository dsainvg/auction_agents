BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A thumb injury before the start of the season in 2018 meant Aditya Tare
  had to wait for his turn. The MI management turned to Ishan Kishan and
  persisted with the youngster. Tare did not feature in any game in the 12th
  edition of the tournament and continues to fight for a spot in the XI
  alongside Kishan and senior pro Quinton de Kock. The story remained the same
  for Tare in the 2020 season as well, thanks to a well-balanced Mumbai
  Indians top order along with consistent performances that didn’t force them
  to chop and change. Tare has been a part of the triumphant Mumbai Indians
  side that won the IPL in 2013. After putting up some notable performances
  for the Mumbai Indians, he was bought by the Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL
  2016. He was bought by the Delhi Daredevils ahead of IPL 2017 and in the
  following season, he was back at his base. The good news is Tare has no
  injury concerns this time and will be able to give his 100 percent whenever
  the team demands.
