BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Four hundred runs during Indiaâ€™s Under 19 World Cup 2020 campaign,
  youngest Indian to score a List A double ton at the age of 17. Yashasvi
  Jaiswal was bought by Rajasthan Royals for INR 2.40 Cr ahead of the IPL
  2020. It was clear that RR looked at Yashasvi as a long term prospect and it
  was with that intention that he was retained ahead of the 15th season. In
  the 2021 season, Yashasvi had an impressive SR scoring 249 runs in 10 games
  from the 168 balls that he faced. He even got his maiden 50 in that season.
  He continued his good form in the 2022 season scoring 258 runs and was
  retained ahead of the 2023 auction. He went one step ahead in the 2023
  season and smashed 625 runs at an average of 48.07 and a scintillating SR of
  163.61. The year 2023 was special for the youngster as on the back of
  truckload of runs, he made his India debut in T20I and Test and went on to
  score 171 on his Test debut, against West Indies. Since then, the bright
  left-handed batter has not looked back and excelled at every opportunity at
  the highest level. He had a phenomenal 2024 year where he made debut for
  India in all three formats and was the second-highest run getter in Tests
  with 1478 runs in the calendar year. Being one of the five players retained
  by Rajasthan speaks volumes of his consistency and importance in the set-up.
  The Southpaw has been in blistering form and would form a crucial part of
  Rajasthan Royals' bid for the second title in IPL 2025.
