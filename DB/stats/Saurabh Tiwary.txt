BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A strongly built cricketer, Saurabh Tiwary is known for his hard-hitting
  skills. This Ranchi batsman became a familiar face as part of India’s U-19
  World Cup-winning team in 2008. But what got him in the limelight was the
  third edition of IPL where he piled up 419 runs in 16 games for the Mumbai
  Indians. His magnificent performance earned him an ODI cap which was then
  followed by a call up to the Royal Challengers Bangalore squad in IPL 2011
  for USD 1.6 million. In recent times though, Tiwary’s willow hasn’t done too
  much of the talking. After having represented MI, RCB and Delhi Daredevils
  previously, Tiwary played for RPS in 2016 and has been representing MI from
  2017. He played 7 games in the 2020 season for the Mumbai Indians and scored
  103 runs with the highest score of 42.
