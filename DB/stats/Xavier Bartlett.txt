BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A standout performer in Australia’s U19 setup, Xavier Bartlett is a
  promising Australian pacer who was part of the 2018 ICC U19 World Cup squad,
  where he honed his skills as a right-arm fast-medium bowler. Bartlett made
  his ODI debut against the West Indies in February 2024, claiming 4/21,
  followed by a T20I debut later that month with 2 wickets against the same
  opposition. Realising his immense potential, Punjab Kings made Bartlett a
  part of their squad for INR 80 Lakhs ahead of IPL 2025. This will provide
  Bartlett with a golden opportunity to sharpen his skills and learn from the
  likes of fellow Australian and coach Ricky Ponting, prominent fast bowlers
  like Lockie Ferguson, Marco Jansen, etc. Joining Punjab Kings, Bartlett adds
  depth to an already formidable pace attack, with the franchise banking on
  his early breakthroughs and slog-over brilliance.
