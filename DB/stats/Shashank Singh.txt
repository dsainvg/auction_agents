BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A hard-hitting right-handed batter who bowls off-spin, Shashank Singh
  hails from Madhya Pradesh. He captained the state’s U19 side and made his
  first-class debut in the 2019-20 Ranji Trophy for Chhattisgarh, scoring a
  gritty 62 against Uttar Pradesh. Known for his explosive hitting and
  finishing abilities, Shashank Singh first entered the IPL spotlight with
  Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) in 2017, followed by stints with
  Rajasthan Royals (2019-20) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (2022). His fortunes
  turned when the Punjab Kings bought him in 2024, and the rest, as they say,
  is history. He repaid their faith with a breakout season, smashing 354 runs
  in 14 matches at a strike rate of 164.65, including an unbeaten 61* off 29
  balls to chase down 200 against Gujarat Titans, cementing his reputation as
  a clutch finisher. He was one of only two players retained by PBKS ahead of
  the IPL 2025 Auction, which was a testament to his growing stature. Shashank
  now forms a core part of PBKS’ batting line-up, with the franchise banking
  on his hard-hitting abilities and ice-cool temperament to deliver
  match-winning performances. As Punjab chase their maiden IPL title in 2025
  under Shreyas Iyer’s leadership, Shashank’s finishing prowess will be key.
