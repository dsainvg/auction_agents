BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The swashbuckling wicketkeeper-batsman will be out to make an impact as
  RR hope to utilise his international experience to guide them and end their
  long run for a second title. The right-hander had scored 328 runs in the IPL
  2020. While he had to leave IPL 2019 midway to join the England team for the
  World Cup 2019 preparations, he made an impact during his eight-game stint,
  scoring 311 runs, following his 548-run season in IPL 2018. Buttler has
  since then added a World Cup glory to his feather but didn’t quite have the
  best of seasons with RR as he scored 254 runs in 7 matches, including a
  sterling century in 2021. Being a senior member of the squad and someone who
  was retained before the auction, Buttler will have a crucial role to play in
  the leadership group first and then set the stage on fire with his
  attractive stroke play.
