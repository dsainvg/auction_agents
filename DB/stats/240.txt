BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    All-rounder Krishnappa Gowtham hogged the limelight on Thursday as he
  became the most expensive uncapped Indian cricketer in the history of IPL.
  He was bought by Chennai Super Kings, after a fierce bidding war, for a
  whopping price of INR 9.25 crore at the IPL 2021 Player Auction. The
  Karnataka all-rounder represented Punjab Kings in the previous two editions
  of the league. Even though Gowtham's stint with Punjab Kings (earlier known
  as Kings XI Punjab) wasn't very successful in the last two editions, the
  32-year-old is hopeful of returning to his best at the Chennai-based
  franchise. Earlier, when Rajasthan Royals picked K Gowtham for a whopping
  INR 6.2 crore from his base price of INR 20 lakhs, many eyebrows were
  raised. Some thought RR had made an error and had probably paid a lot more
  than they should have. However, K Gowtham delivered for the team with both
  bat and ball in crunch situations and gave a good account of himself. It is
  thanks to him that RR could finish out close matches, which eventually
  helped them qualify for the IPL 2018 Playoffs.
