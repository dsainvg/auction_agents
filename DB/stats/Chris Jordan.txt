BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Chris Jordan burst on the county circuit as an 18-year-old in 2007 when
  he picked up 20 wickets in five county championship games for Surrey. His
  career has been often plagued by injuries but his exploits in the shortest
  format of the game are well known. Known to be a quality death bowler and
  for some hard-hitting shots lower down the order, Jordan was drafted for the
  first time into the IPL in 2016 by the Royal Challengers Bangalore. He was
  acquired by the Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs. 50 Lakh in the 2017 edition. The
  Punjab Kings picked him in the 2020 auction for INR 3 cr and picked 9
  wickets in the season. His sensational fielding efforts in the outfield also
  adds a lot of value to the team as the Punjab Kings retained the right arm
  pacer for the 14th edition.
