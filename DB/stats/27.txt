BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Shivam Mavi caught everyone’s attention in the 2018 India U19 World Cup
  where he bowled at a seething pace. He clocked more than 140 kmph regularly
  and soon became the talk of the tournament owing to his fast bowling
  abilities. Known to have a lethal bouncer and a constant drive to improve
  and become faster, Mavi is definitely one of the most exciting young
  upcoming fast bowlers. After a brilliant outing in the U19 World Cup, Mavi
  was quick to grab attention in the IPL Auction and was ultimately picked up
  by KKR for a cool 3 crores. He made his IPL debut for KKR in 2018 but picked
  up just 5 wickets. A stress fracture in his back ruled him out of playing
  competitive cricket since December 2019 and after spending most of his time
  in rehab, Mavi was fit and raring to go in the 2020 edition. He played in 8
  games and picked up 9 wickets in the 2020 IPL season.
