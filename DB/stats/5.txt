BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  An astute and skillful left-arm pacer, Arshdeep Singh first burst onto
  the IPL scene when Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings) signed him for INR 20
  lakh at the 2019 auction. Hailing from Guna, Madhya Pradesh, Arshdeep honed
  his skills in Chandigarh. The left-arm pacer had already shone in Punjab’s
  age-group cricket, while also playing a key role in India’s 2018 U19 World
  Cup triumph with 7 wickets, including a frugal 1/7 in the final against
  Australia. He made his first-class debut for Punjab in the 2018-19 Ranji
  Trophy and debuted in T20s during the 2018 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy,
  impressing with his swing and pace. His IPL breakthrough came in 2021,
  taking 18 wickets in 12 matches, and he solidified his reputation in 2022
  with 10 wickets, including a nerveless Super Over against Mumbai Indians.
  Retained by PBKS for 2023 and 2024, he peaked in 2024 with 19 wickets in 14
  matches, finishing as the joint third-highest wicket-taker with a standout
  4/29 against Sunrisers Hyderabad. The year 2024 was a career-defining one
  for the 26-year-old. Beyond his IPL heroics, Arshdeep starred in India’s T20
  World Cup triumph, claiming 15 wickets, including a match-sealing 3/20 in
  the final against South Africa and also won the ICC T20I Cricketer of the
  Year. Ahead of IPL 2025, Punjab Kings bagged the left-armer for a whopping
  INR 18 Crore, exhibiting the trust the franchise has on his abilities. As
  Punjab chase their maiden IPL title in 2025 under Ricky Ponting’s guidance,
  Arshdeep’s pinpoint yorkers, new-ball swing, and big-match temperament will
  be pivotal to their campaign.
