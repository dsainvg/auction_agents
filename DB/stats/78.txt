    Rahul Tripathi, who represents Maharashtra in domestic cricket, has been

  Rising Pune Supergiant, he pummelled the bowlers to make his presence felt
  in the IPL. He slammed a highest of 93 as he gathered 391 runs from 12
  matches. He played for the Rajasthan Royals in 2018 and 2019 but did not
  have the best of seasons. He was traded in the KKR line-up after being
  brought in the 2020 IPL Auction for 60 lakhs.
