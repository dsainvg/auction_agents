BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Leg spinners are a huge attraction in the T20 format and the young Ravi
  Bishnoi has it in him to be the next star spinner. The 19-year-old was
  picked up for a whopping INR 2 crore at the auction and the amount is enough
  to estimate the interest he generated among various franchises. It is not
  only the money, but Bishnoi will have everything going for him in this IPL
  as he will be under the tutelage of Anil Kumble, who is the Head Coach of
  PBKS. It is an ideal setting for a prodigy to learn from the master of the
  craft and also pick his astute cricket brains. In the U19 World Cup, Bishnoi
  picked up 17 wickets from just six games and finished as the top
  wicket-taker in the tournament. All eyes were on him when he made his IPL
  debut and the right-arm spinner lived up to the expectations, bowling tight
  overs for PBKS throughout the 2020 season as he managed to pick 12 wickets.
  Bishnoi will be looking to capitalize on his past performance and make full
  use of the Indian conditions for the 2021 season.
