BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The promising bowler from Bengal has steadily come up the ranks starting
  from U19 to domestic and then for India A. He uses his height to his
  advantage and can get the ball to bounce sharply. This is a welcome addition
  to the squad by PBKS who was picked for his base price of INR 20 lakh and he
  is a future star. Coach Anil Kumble has said that he is the right backup for
  their ace speedster Mohammed Shami, who too plays for Bengal. The youngster
  has lots to learn and one hopes that he gets to make his IPL debut.
