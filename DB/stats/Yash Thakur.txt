    A standout performer in India’s U19 setup, Yash Thakur was part of the
  victorious ACC Under-19 Asia Cup-winning team in 2016, picking up 9 wickets
  in 5 games. The fiery right-arm pacer made his first-class debut for
  Vidarbha in the 2018-19 Ranji Trophy. His IPL debut came for Lucknow Super
  Giants against Chennai Super Kings in 2023, and he quickly made an impact,
  finishing his maiden season with 13 wickets in 9 matches, including a
  memorable 4/37 against Punjab Kings. Retained by LSG for 2024, Thakur
  elevated his game further, claiming 11 wickets in 10 matches, highlighted by
  a sensational 5/30 against Gujarat Titans, his first IPL five-wicket haul.
  Punjab Kings acquired him for INR 1.6 crore at the IPL 2025 mega auction,
  recognizing his potential as a game-changer. Thakur now forms a vital part
  of PBKS’s pace attack, with the franchise banking on his fiery pace,
  pinpoint yorkers, and match-winning performances to fuel their quest for a
  maiden IPL title in 2025.
