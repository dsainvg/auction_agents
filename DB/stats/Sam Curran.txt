BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Punjab Kings created history at the 2023 auctions, breaking the bank for
  England’s versatile all-rounder Sam Curran. The 24-year-old emerged as the
  costliest buy after PBKS bought him for a gobsmacking amount of Rs. 18.5
  crore. Curran broke the record which was previously held by South Africa
  all-rounder Chris Morris – the Royals had spent Rs. 16.5 crore at the IPL
  2021 auction. The Northampton-born wily cricketer, who made his IPL debut
  three years ago, immediately stood out, picking 13 wickets and 95 runs, with
  a highest score of an unbeaten 55. He also played a vital role for England
  in their T20 World Cup campaign, with 13 scalps and was adjudged the Player
  of the Tournament. In 2020, after being promoted to the top, Curran proved
  his credentials with the bat, scoring 186 runs with a half-century for
  Chennai Super Kings. IPL 2021 was a difficult year for Curran as he bagged
  just nine wickets and didn't impress either with 56 runs. He opted out of
  the IPL 2022 mega auction to focus on rehab.
