BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Hailing from South Africa, Dewald Brevis is an explosive right-handed
  batter known for his attacking style and ability to strike the ball hard and
  long. Often compared to AB de Villiers for his stroke play, Brevis earned
  the nickname ‘Baby AB’ early in his career. He has featured in 81 T20s,
  scoring 1787 runs with a highest of 162, and represented South Africa in two
  T20Is in 2023. He also brings IPL experience, having played for Mumbai
  Indians in 2022 and 2024. Now, in another significant step in his young
  career, the 21-year-old has been signed by Chennai Super Kings for INR 2.2
  Crores for TATA IPL 2025 as a replacement for Gurjapneet Singh. With the
  chance to share the dressing room with the likes of MS Dhoni and Devon
  Conway, Brevis’ power-hitting could prove vital for CSK, especially in the
  powerplay.
