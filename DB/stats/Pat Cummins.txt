BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Pat Cummins is Australia’s premier fast bowler and one of the top
  pace-bowling all-rounders globally. With over 500 wickets in international
  cricket, Cummins has become a pivotal figure in Australian cricket. His rise
  has been equally impressive, as he has seamlessly transitioned into
  leadership roles, captaining Australia to victory in the 2023 ODI World Cup
  and the World Test Championship 2021-2023. He also played a key role in
  Australia's T20 World Cup 2021 win as vice-captain. In the IPL, Cummins made
  his debut in 2014 with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), before a stint with
  Delhi Capitals in 2017. His second spell at KKR saw him make an
  unforgettable impact, not just with the ball but also with the bat, smashing
  the fastest IPL fifty in just 14 balls. In IPL 2024, Pat Cummins was one of
  the most expensive buys, with Sunrisers Hyderabad acquiring him for a
  whopping INR 20.50 Crore. He immediately lived up to the hype, leading SRH
  to a runners-up finish in the season. For TATA IPL 2025, Cummins has been
  retained by SRH, and he will continue to be their leader.
