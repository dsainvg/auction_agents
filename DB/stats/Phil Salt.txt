BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Aggressive and consistent at the top of the order, Phil Salt is the kind
  of batter that can take the game away from the opposition very early. The
  fact that he has a strike-rate of over 164 after more than 40 T20Is for
  England shows just how destructive he can be. Salt’s first stint in the TATA
  IPL came in the 2023 season, when he represented Delhi Capitals and
  impressed in the games that he played. But it was in the 2024 season, after
  coming into the Kolkata Knight Riders side as a replacement for compatriot
  Jason Roy, that Salt took the IPL by storm by playing a huge role in KKR’s
  title victory with 435 runs in 12 games at an average of almost 40 and a
  fantastic strike-rate of 182. Salt, who was part of England’s 2022 T20 World
  Cup winning campaign, is now a crucial member of the limited-overs set up.
  He was acquired by RCB for a whopping INR 11.5 Crore ahead of TATA IPL 2025.
