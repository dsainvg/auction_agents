BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Tushar Deshpande announced himself in the 2015-16 Cooch Behar Trophy,
  grabbing 21 wickets in just four matches, which earned him a place in
  Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy squad the same year. He made his debut against Tamil
  Nadu and later made his List A debut in the 2018 Vijay Hazare Trophy, where
  he claimed a maiden five-wicket haul in the quarter-finals. His consistency
  in white-ball cricket led to a call-up to the India 'B' squad for the 2019
  Duleep Trophy, and soon after, he was picked by Delhi Capitals in the IPL
  2020 auction. In 2022, Chennai Super Kings acquired him in the mega auction,
  and Deshpande etched his name in history by becoming the first-ever Impact
  Player in IPL 2023. That season proved to be his breakthrough year, as he
  spearheaded CSK’s pace attack with 21 wickets in 16 matches, emerging as
  their highest wicket-taker in a title-winning campaign. He continued his
  strong form in IPL 2024, adding 17 wickets while excelling in domestic
  cricket, where he played a pivotal role in Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy triumph
  with 15 wickets. That season also saw him register his maiden first-class
  century. His stellar performances earned him an India debut against Zimbabwe
  in July 2024. At the IPL 2025 auction, Rajasthan Royals secured his services
  for INR 6.5 crore. Now an experienced campaigner, he will be a key weapon in
  RR’s pace attack alongside Sandeep Sharma and Jofra Archer.
