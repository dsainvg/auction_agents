BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Navdeep Saini is one of the brightest fast bowling prospects in India at
  the moment. He can quite comfortably clock in excess of 140 kmph on the
  speed gun. He was the star of Delhi's campaign as they reached the Ranji
  Trophy final in 2017-18. 34 wickets in 8 games is a brilliant return for
  someone so young and who has yet to make the grade at International level.
  He was bought by Delhi Daredevils in the tenth edition of the league. 2018
  Player Auction saw a fierce bidding war for the youngster and RCB
  successfully emerged on top to buy him for INR 3cr.
