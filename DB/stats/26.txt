BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Marcus Stoinis, a powerful batter and medium-pace bowler, has been a key
  figure in Australia’s limited-overs setup for years. Nicknamed the ‘Hulk,’
  he combines explosive power-hitting with effective swing bowling, making him
  a formidable all-rounder. He debuted for Australia in 2015 against England
  but truly announced himself in his second ODI, smashing an unbeaten 146,
  coming in at No. 7 and taking three wickets in a near-perfect match-winning
  effort against New Zealand. He has a knack of stitching match-winning
  partnerships, and one of the notable ones came in the 2021 T20 World Cup
  semi-final, where his 81-run stand with Matthew Wade rescued Australia
  against Pakistan. Stoinis has excelled in the IPL, playing a pivotal role in
  Delhi Capitals' run to the final in 2020 and Lucknow Super Giants’ 2023
  campaign. In the year 2025, Stoinis is set for a homecoming as he returns to
  Punjab Kings, the franchise where he first played in 2016 and was then known
  as Kings XI Punjab. Having being acquired for a whopping INR 11 Crore,
  Stoinis will look to live up to his reputation for delivering on the big
  stage. His explosive batting and crucial breakthroughs will be vital as
  Punjab Kings chase their maiden IPL title.
