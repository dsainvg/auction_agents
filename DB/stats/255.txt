- Rajan Kumar Career

Born on July 08, 1996, in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, Rajan Kumar is a left-arm medium-fast bowler and a right-handed batter. He represents his home team Uttarakhand in the domestic circuit and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Kumar grabbed some spotlight when he was grabbed by the Royal Challengers Bangalore (now Royal Challengers Bengaluru) in the IPL 2023 auction. He has only played a handful of domestic matches but has made quite an impact within the short span. The 28-year-old left-arm pacer looks up to veteran Australian speedster Mitchell Johnson as his cricketing idol.

A month later, Kumar made his List-A debut for Uttarakhand against Odisha in Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2022-23 season. Like his SMAT debut, he was again impressive on his Vijay Hazare Trophy debut as he finished with figures of 8.2-1-24-3.
