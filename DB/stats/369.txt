BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A tall pacer, Lungi Ngidi made his debut for South Africa in 2017 against
  Sri Lanka and was adjudged the Man of the Match. Ngidi was identified as a
  T20 prospect early on when he finished as the joint second-highest
  wicket-taker in the Africa Cup, a provincial T20 tournament that serves as a
  curtain raiser to the season, in September 2015. Even though Ngidi was a
  prospect for limited overs, his maiden Test call arrived against India at
  Centurion. Once again Ngidi had a dream debut and was adjudged the Man of
  the Match. Ngidi clearly came under the limelight that resulted in him
  getting a contract with the Chennai Super Kings at the IPL.
