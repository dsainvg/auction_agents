BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It was a moment of delight followed by a round of applause across the
  tables at the IPL 2021 Player Auction when Chennai Super Kings bought
  Cheteshwar Pujara and added him to their squad. The Indian test specialist,
  last played an IPL game in the 2014 edition of the league and went unsold
  ever since. It was in February, when Pujara was picked at his base price of
  INR 50 lakhs at the auction. A prodigious scorer on the domestic circuit,
  Cheteshwar Pujara’s reputation preceded his arrival on the international
  scene. When he did eventually don the India cap for the first time, the
  25-year old from Saurashtra proved he had the big-match temperament to back
  his skills. In 2012, as Indian batsmen struggled to counter the potent
  England attack at home, Pujara seemed to be batting on different tracks –
  scoring a double century and a ton in consecutive Tests. Pujara has worked
  on his attacking instincts and added the aerial shots to his batting
  repertoire. The good thing is he has managed to do that without compromising
  on his class. He has also led the India ‘A’ side. After playing for Royal
  Challengers Bangalore, Pujara represented KXIP in 2014.
