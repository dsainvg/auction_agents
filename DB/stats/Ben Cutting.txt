BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A true impact player, Ben Cutting is someone who can change the
  complexion of the game with his all-round abilities. As a batsman, he can
  hit the ball a mile while batting down the order and his bowling adds more
  strength to the attack. The Australian made his T20I and One-Day
  International (ODI) debuts for his nation in 2013. He was a part of the
  Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals setups but made his impact for the
  Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2016. In the final against Royal Challengers
  Bangalore, his 15-ball 39 not out took Hyderabad past 200. He wasn’t done
  there as he delivered with a spell of two for 35 to help his side clinch the
  title. Ahead of the 2018 season, Mumbai Indians signed him up. Cutting was
  picked by the Kolkata Knight Riders ahead of the 2021 season.
