BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Swapnil Singh was considered one of the young stars to watch out for
  during his junior cricket days, almost even making it to India’s U-19 World
  Cup side in 2008. The left-arm orthodox spinner from Uttar Pradesh has
  represented both Baroda and Uttarakhand in domestic cricket and has gained
  great experience over the years, which includes stints with multiple teams
  in the TATA IPL. After a stellar Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy season in
  2015-16, during which he also picked 6/19 in one of the games, he went on to
  represent Punjab Kings in the 2016 season. After also playing for Lucknow
  Super Giants along the way, Singh played a key role in Royal Challengers
  Bengaluru’s superb comeback in 2024 en route to making the playoffs. RCB
  brought him back on board for the 2025 season.
