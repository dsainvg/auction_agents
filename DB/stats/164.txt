BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The tall and powerful middle-order batter earned a reputation as one of
  the most sought-after T20 finishers in the world with his impactful batting
  in a range of tournaments. His first stint in the TATA IPL was with Royal
  Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in 2021, but he grabbed great attention when
  Mumbai Indians spent INR 8.25 crore to bring him on board in the 2022 Mega
  Auction. He showed why he was rated so highly in the first season itself,
  boasting a strike rate of more than 200, including a match-winning 46 off 18
  against Sunrisers Hyderabad which was his most prominent knock from that
  campaign. David has been a regular feature in the Australian T20I set-up
  over the past few years. Now back with RCB ahead of IPL 2025, the
  Bengaluru-based team will bank on him to provide that crucial impetus in the
  slog overs.
