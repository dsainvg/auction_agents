BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mustafizur Rahman is a left-arm pace bowler who came to Dhaka in 2012 to
  try his luck at a fast-bowler’s camp, after he had impressed in an Under-17
  tournament in his hometown Satkhira. He was admitted to the Bangladesh
  Cricket Board's pace foundation and soon caught the coaches' attention to
  make the Bangladesh Under-19 side for the 2014 World Cup. He initially
  lacked pace, but built it up through the 2014-15 first-class season, when he
  took 26 wickets. An international call up came soon and Mustafizur impressed
  straightaway making some of the best in the business look tentative against
  him. He enjoyed great success against India in the Asia Cup in 2016 and
  caught the eye worldwide for his ability to generate good pace and for his
  deceptive slower one. The IPL 2016 was his first stint with the IPL and he
  was known for his lethal yorker to KKR all-rounder Andre Russell. He was
  impressive for SRH last year and would be looking to do well in the 2017
  edition as well. RR acquired Mustafizur's services after bringing him on the
  board for INR 1 Cr. The left-arm pacer from Bangladesh has thus far played
  three IPL seasons and has 24 IPL wickets to his name and he will be looking
  to add a few more wickets to his tally as RR look to clinch the IPL 2021
  title.
