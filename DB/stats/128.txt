BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Darshan Nalkande has played only a handful of games in domestic cricket
  having just broken into first-class cricket with the former Ranji Trophy
  champions Vidarbha. But that was good enough for Punjab Kings to snap him up
  at the player auctions for a salary of INR 30 lakhs. He made an instant
  impact on his Vijay Hazare Trophy debut when he scored an unbeaten 56 from
  just 30 balls to take Vidarbha to an improbable victory over Maharashtra,
  even though he is known more for his skills with the ball. He did not play
  any games in 2019 and 2020 seasons but was retained by PBKS ahead of the
  2021 IPL auction.
