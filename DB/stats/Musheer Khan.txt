BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Musheer Khan is one of Indian cricket’s brightest young talents, making
  waves with his all-round abilities. Born in Mumbai, he grew up immersed in
  the game under the guidance of his father, Naushad Khan, who also coached
  his elder brother, Sarfaraz Khan. From an early age, Musheer honed his
  skills at Mumbai’s iconic Azad Maidan, laying the foundation for his
  cricketing journey. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai in December
  2022 during the Ranji Trophy but truly announced himself in 2024 at the U-19
  Cricket World Cup. Emerging as one of the tournament’s top all-rounders, he
  amassed 360 runs in seven matches and claimed seven wickets, playing a
  crucial role in India’s run to the final. Despite India finishing as
  runners-up, his performances earned him a spot in the ICC Team of the
  Tournament. In February 2024, Musheer played a match-winning knock in the
  Ranji Trophy quarterfinals against Baroda. Weeks after turning 19, he
  created history in the final against Vidarbha, scoring a century and
  becoming the youngest Mumbai batter to achieve this feat, surpassing Sachin
  Tendulkar’s long-standing record. Carrying this momentum, Musheer earned his
  maiden IPL contract, signing with Punjab Kings for INR 30 lakh ahead of the
  2025 edition. This marks a crucial learning curve for the young all-rounder
  as he shares the dressing room with stalwarts like captain Shreyas Iyer and
  coach Ricky Ponting - an experience that will further refine his skills and
  shape his promising future.
