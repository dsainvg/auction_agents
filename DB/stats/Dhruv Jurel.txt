  scored 152 runs at an excellent Strike Rate of 172.72. The year 2024 was
  extremely fruitful for the young wicket-keeper batter. He smashed 195 runs
  at a strike rate of 138.29 and was involved in many pivotal matches with
  winning performances for RR. His heroics helped RR to qualify for the
  playoffs. Soon after his IPL success, he made his international debut
  against England in 2024 and impressed with a gritty 46 off 104 balls. Jurel
  was one of the five players retained by Rajasthan Royals ahead of IPL 2025,
