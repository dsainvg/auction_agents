BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Shakib Al Hasan is arguably Bangladesh’s greatest cricketer. A dependable
  left-handed batsman who can anchor the innings, a wicket-taking orthodox
  bowler who can keep it tight and a safe fielder, Shakib has rallied his
  nation with consistent performances across formats. Since the late 2010s, he
  has been their mainstay and has also captained them. On the world stage, his
  finest hour came during the 2019 World Cup in England where he scored a
  mind-boggling 606 runs along with 11 wickets – statistics that truly
  highlight his value. Picked by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2011, he was an
  important part of their two title-winning sides in 2012 and 2014. In the
  2012 final, his calm cameo at the end helped Kolkata clinch the title. As an
  all-rounder, he is invaluable to any side in T20 cricket. In 2018, Shakib
  had been picked by the Sunrisers Hyderabad. He now returns to Kolkata, where
  he first tasted IPL success.
