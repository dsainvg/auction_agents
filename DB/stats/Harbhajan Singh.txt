BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One of the greatest off-spinners India has produced, Harbhajan Singh made
  his debut for India in the late 1990s as a teenager. In 2001, his 32 wickets
  in three Tests against Australia put him in the spotlight and he then
  established himself as one of India’s strike bowlers for a decade
  thereafter. Along the way, he was a part of the successful Indian teams that
  clinched the 2007 T20 World Cup in South Africa and the 2011 World Cup on
  home soil. In the IPL, he was a senior member of the Mumbai Indians for the
  first ten years and was a part of three title-winning sides. In 2011, he
  bagged a five-wicket haul in a win against the Chennai Super Kings. While
  his bowling has been in focus, he has also contributed with some hitting
  lower down the order. An innings of 64 against Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab
  Kings) in 2015 showcased what he was capable of. In 2018, Harbhajan moved to
  the Chennai Super Kings, where they clinched another title in a fairytale
  season. He gets set to represent Kolkata Knight Riders, his third team in
  the IPL.
