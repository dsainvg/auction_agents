BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Sandeep Sharma, the right-arm medium pacer from Punjab, rose to
  prominence during the 2012 Under-19 ICC Cricket World Cup. His four wickets
  in the final propelled India to the title and made him the team’s
  joint-highest wicket-taker in the tournament with 12 scalps. The pacer made
  his first-class debut in 2011 and earned a contract with the Kings XI Punjab
  ahead of IPL 2013. He was bought back by the franchise in the 2014 auction.
  He has earned high praise from experts for his ability to swing the ball and
  has played a key role for his stateside Punjab. He picked up 17 wickets in
  the 2017 edition with best bowling figures of 4/20. He formed a lethal
  partnership with Bhuvneshwar Kumar at Sunrisers Hyderabad. He's added a lot
  of variations to his armoury and can bowl at any stage of the game. Sandeep
  has been a consistent performer in the IPL with 114 wickets from 104 matches
  at an impressive average of 26.33 and economy rate of 7.77. He was named as
  replacement of the injured Prasidh Krishna by Rajasthan Royals ahead of the
  2023 season. Sandeep's experience and wicket-taking abilities might be
  crucial for RR in the upcoming season.
