BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    As a batsman it is hard not to get intimidated when a strapping,
  broad-shouldered fast bowler from the Caribbean looks down on you from six
  feet seven inches. That’s probably one reason why sides in the shortest
  format decide to include Jason Holder in their squads. The young pacer from
  Barbados rose to prominence when he topped the West Indies bowling charts in
  the 2010 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. With a first-class bowling
  average of under 22 and a sub-50 strike-rate, Holder played his first match
  for the West Indies in the 2013 ODI series against Australia. After
  representing the Chennai Super Kings in 2013, the Sunrisers Hyderabad in
  2015, Kolkata Knight Riders in 2016, Holder was back in the 2020 season with
  the Sunrisers Hyderabad. He was a replacement player for all-rounder
  Mitchell Marsh and made his presence felt featuring in 7 games and picking
  14 wickets that included a match-winning 3-wicket haul against Royal
  Challengers Bangalore.
