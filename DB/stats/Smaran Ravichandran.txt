BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Smaran Ravichandran, a hard-hitting left-handed batter from Karnataka, is
  known for his ability to clear the boundary with ease. After consistently
  impressing at the junior level, he made his senior debut for Karnataka in
  the 2024-25 domestic season. In seven first-class matches so far, he has
  scored 516 runs at an impressive average of 64.50, including back-to-back
  centuries against Punjab and Haryana. The 21-year-old has also shone in
  other formats, averaging 72.16 in 10 List A games and 34 in six T20s, all
  representing Karnataka. His standout performance came in the Vijay Hazare
  Trophy 2025 final, where his match-winning 101 against Vidarbha helped
  Karnataka lift the trophy. His consistent run earned him his first IPL
  contract as he was signed by Sunrisers Hyderabad for INR 30 lakhs as a
  replacement for Australian spinner Adam Zampa. Sharing the dressing room
  with stars like Travis Head, Pat Cummins, and Abhishek Sharma is expected to
  be a key learning experience in Smaran’s young career.
