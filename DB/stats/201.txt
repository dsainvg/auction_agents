BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Yudhvir Singh Charak, a promising right-arm pacer, made an impactful IPL
  debut, picking up two wickets for Lucknow Super Giants in the 2023 edition.
  The Jammu-born speedster, known for his natural pace, has honed his skills
  from a young age and emerged as a standout talent in domestic U19 cricket.
  He made his T20 debut for Hyderabad in the 2019 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy
  against Chandigarh and also marked his first-class debut the same year.
  Yudhvir first entered the IPL circuit when Mumbai Indians signed him for the
  2021 edition, making him only the second cricketer from Jammu to feature in
  the tournament. Ahead of IPL 2025, Rajasthan Royals secured the talented
  pacer for INR 35 lakhs. This move presents an exciting learning opportunity
  for Yudhvir, as he will gain valuable insights from teammates like Sanju
  Samson, Jofra Archer, and Sandeep Sharma to further refine his bowling
  skills.
