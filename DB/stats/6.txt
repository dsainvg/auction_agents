BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A batsman from the Bombay school of cricket, Prithvi Shaw has shown the
  ability to perform in crucial games. Captain of India’s Under-19 World Cup
  winning team, Prithvi was retained by Delhi Capitals ahead of the IPL 2020
  and IPL 2021. The opener made in the domestic circuit and scored centuries
  on debut in Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy, and then added a third feather
  to his cap by becoming the youngest Indian Test centurion on debut in 2018.
  However, Shaw’s form dipped after scoring 2 fifties in the IPL 2020 and then
  in the subsequent Australia tour. But, the aggressive right-hander bounced
  back in style and hammered 827 runs in 8 matches to power Mumbai to the
  Vijay Hazare Trophy triumph and will be keen to continue his brilliant run
  of form when he takes the field for his IPL franchise.
