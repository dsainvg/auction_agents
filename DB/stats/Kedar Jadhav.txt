BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A powerful batsman and a handy off-spinner, Kedar Jadhav was the leading
  run-getter in the Ranji Trophy 2013-14 season and played a crucial role in
  taking his team to the tournament final. The aggressive middle-order batsman
  scored his maiden triple ton in the Ranji Trophy 2012-13 season, against
  Uttar Pradesh and was the second highest run-getter for his team in the
  season. His strong performances in domestic cricket earned him an ODI
  call-up in 2014 and a T20I debut in 2015. Kedar then became a regular
  feature in national colours often putting up notable performances lower down
  the order. He also delivered a few finishing touches to tough run-chases for
  his IPL franchises over the years. An attacking middle-order batsman Kedar
  Jadhav, has represented Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals), Royal
  Challengers Bangalore & Chennai Super Kings in the previous editions. He
  will now represent Sunrisers Hyderabad.
