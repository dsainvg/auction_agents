BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A stylish top-order batsman from Punjab, Manan Vohra has been piling on
  the runs from the time he began playing age-group cricket. A member of the
  Under-19 World Cup-winning team led by Umnukt Chand, Manan was first snapped
  up by Kings XI Punjab in 2013 and made an unbeaten 43 on debut. In IPL 2017,
  he struck his career-best 95 playing against SRH. At the IPL Player Auction
  2018, Manan was bought by Royal Challengers Bangalore for INR 1.1 crore, but
  was released by the franchise thereafter. The Rajasthan Royals secured his
  services for IPL 2019 at a salary of INR 20 lakh and was retained for IPL
  2020. Manan enjoyed a solid run of form in the Ranji Trophy 2019-20, scoring
  591 runs for Chandigarh and also scored 154 runs (from 4 games) in Syed
  Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2020-21 and 276 runs (from 5 matches) in the Vijay Hazare
  Trophy 2020-21. The right-hander will be keen to score big for Rajasthan
  Royals in IPL 2021.
