BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Veteran medium-pacer Tim Southee has a repertoire for swing. Ever since
  his breakthrough into the New Zealand national side, he had taken over the
  mantle of being his country’s premier bowler at a very young age. He made
  his international debut when he was just 19 and over the years proved his
  worth across formats and against the best in the sport. A wonderful bowler
  to have at the death with his pinpoint yorkers, Southee has abundance of
  talent and time and again been a vital cog in New Zealand’s bowling line-up.
  Southee, who has proven his skills with both red and white balls, is useful
  with the bat as well. He's represented Chennai Super Kings, Rajasthan
  Royals, Royal Challengers Bangalore & Mumbai Indians in the past with
  varying success in the IPL but has also demonstrated that he can hit the
  long ball when he's asked to do so, adding further utility to his game. This
  year he will be donning purple and gold for the Kolkata Knight Riders.
