BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A prolific run-getter since his early days in the game, AmbatiRayudu
  plied his trade at Mumbai Indians last time around and now he will get a
  chance to play under MS Dhoni this season. Once referred to as India’s next
  batting star, Rayudu announced his arrival when he scored 177 as a
  16-year-old against an England U-19 team in 2002. Stints at the National
  Cricket Academy and an outstanding second season in domestic cricket only
  enhanced his reputation. The 30-year-old was held on to by Mumbai Indians
  prior to IPL 2011 when all IPL squads got a makeover. And given his
  consistent run over the last three seasons, Rayudu was again retained by MI
  prior to IPL 2014. In the 2015 season, Rayudu made 281 runs at a S/R of 145
  and remained not out on five occasions. Once a regular in the Indian ODI
  team, Rayudu would come in handy for the CSK in the middle-order, if needed.
