BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    He idolises former Australian gloveman Adam Gilchrist and tries to
  emulate his playing style. A key contributor in the top order during India’s
  successful campaign at the 2008 U-19 World Cup in Malaysia, Goswami is safe
  behind the stumps and aggressive when armed with the bat. He was roped in by
  the Royal Challengers Bangalore for the first two seasons of the IPL and
  performed modestly in the few outings he got. During his stint with the
  Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL 2011, he only managed a top score of 22 in
  seven matches. Transferred to the Rajasthan Royals prior to IPL 2012, he
  kept wickets in 11 games in his first season with the franchise and affected
  four catches and four stumpings. He has not been on the IPL radar since then
  with the advent of new attacking wicketkeeper batsmen but Sunrisers have
  instilled faith in him and retained him back in the mix.
