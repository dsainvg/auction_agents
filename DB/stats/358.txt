Apr 18, 1992... KL Rahul is one of the most determined, composed, talented, and stylish batters in modern-day cricket. Born in 1992, in Karnataka, KL Rahul is a wicketkeeper-batter who made his first-class Debut in 2010. His consistent performances in India's A tour of Australia and the 2014-15 domestic season earned him a Test call up for India's tour of Australia.... In just his second Test, KL Rahul impressed everyone at the big stage and scored a magnificent century against Australia in Sydney. He made his T20I and ODI Debuts in Harare against Zimbabwe, in 2016. With his flexibility of batting at any position and a fine record with the gloves, KL Rahul is one of the most dependable players that Indian cricket has ever seen.... His ability to hit mammoth sixes and bat for long periods of time makes KL Rahul equally effective across formats. The wicketkeeper-batter has a terrific record away from home in Test cricket, with nine centuries outside India in the longest format. He played a crucial role in India’s ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Campaigns in 2019 and 2023, scoring over 800 runs.
