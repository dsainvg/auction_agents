BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  One of the premier leg-spinners going around in the world, Yuzvendra
  Chahal, needs no introduction. Deception with flight, sharp turn, and luring
  the batter to play a false shot will often be seen when Chahal spins his
  magic. He has had a solid international career so far with the Indian team
  in the limited-overs, picking up 121 wickets in ODIs and 96 wickets in
  T20Is. Being the second-highest wicket-taker for India in T20Is shows his
  quality as a game-changer of the highest quality. The crafty leg-spinner
  began his IPL journey with Mumbai Indians in 2011, but it was with Royal
  Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) from 2014 that he truly made his mark. He became
  RCB’s leading wicket-taker over eight seasons, scalping 139 wickets in 113
  matches. Chahal played a pivotal role in their 2016 final run, finishing as
  the tournament’s second-highest wicket-taker with 21 scalps. After a stellar
  stint, the Rajasthan Royals snapped him up ahead of the 2022 season, and
  Chahal responded spectacularly, clinching the Purple Cap with 27 wickets
  while guiding RR to the final. In 2023, he picked up 21 wickets, and in
  2024, he added 18 more at an economy of 9.41, cementing his status as the
  IPL’s all-time leading wicket-taker with 205 wickets by the end of that
  season. He added another memorable milestone by becoming the first bowler to
  reach 200 IPL wickets and was part of India’s ICC T20 World Cup-winning
  squad in 2024. Ahead of IPL 2025, Punjab Kings secured his services for a
  whopping INR 18 crore at the mega-auction, speaking volumes of his enduring
  value. He joins PBKS as a core member, with the franchise banking on his
  experience and wicket-taking ability to chase their maiden IPL title in
  2025. With a career strike rate hovering around 17 in the IPL and a knack
  for turning games, Punjab will look to their new spin spearhead to deliver
  impactful performances in the season ahead.
