BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Shreyas Iyer, a name synonymous with elegance and flair, has firmly
  established himself in the cricketing world. Hailing from Mumbai, a city
  renowned for producing legends, he is among the most promising batters of
  his generation. He led India’s U19 side to the 2016 World Cup quarterfinals
  with 315 runs in six matches and made waves in first-class cricket, debuting
  for Mumbai in the 2014-15 Ranji Trophy with a stunning 173 against
  Saurashtra. Iyer continued his dominance in domestic cricket, captaining
  Mumbai to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title in 2024-25 with 281 runs at a
  strike rate of 162.42, including a match-winning 73* off 33 in the final.
  His brilliance was maximised in the 2023 ICC Cricket World Cup, where he
  struck two centuries, including a sensational 105 against New Zealand in the
  semi-final, playing a crucial role in India’s campaign. He further cemented
  his stature in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, finishing as the tournament’s
  second-highest run-scorer and India's leading batter, proving instrumental
  in India’s title-winning run. In the IPL, Iyer’s journey has been nothing
  short of remarkable. After a breakthrough 2018 season with Delhi Daredevils
  (now Delhi Capitals), where he amassed 411 runs, he took over the captaincy
  in 2019, guiding them to consecutive playoffs in that year and the following
  year. He was then picked by the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024 and his
  leadership peaked here. His led KKR to their third IPL title, scoring 351
  runs at a strike rate of 146.86. At the 2025 mega auction, Punjab Kings
  secured him for a record INR 26.75 crore, entrusting him with the captaincy
  to spearhead their title quest. With PBKS chasing their maiden IPL triumph,
  Iyer’s explosive batting and astute leadership will be pivotal in shaping a
  core that could lead the franchise to long-awaited glory.
