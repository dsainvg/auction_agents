BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Jasprit Bumrah has been with MI from the start of his career, making his
  debut in the 2013 season. Bumrah has been instrumental for the Mumbai
  franchise as he finished as the team's highest wicket-taker in three of
  their IPL title wins (2017, 2019, and 2020). For both the franchise and the
  Indian National team, Bumrah has established himself as the mainstay and one
  of the most dependable fast bowlers across all formats and in any phase of
  the game. His unique action makes it tough for the batters to pick him early
  whereas his deadly yorkers and deceptive slower deliveries add icing on the
  cake. He was also named the ‘Player of the Series’ for India at the 2024
  T20I World Cup. Bumrah was retained ahead of TATA IPL 2025 and will enter
  the season after being named the ICC Men’s Cricketer of the Year 2024.
