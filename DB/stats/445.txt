BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  An aggressive middle-order batter, Charith Asalanka has been a key figure
  in Sri Lanka's limited-overs setup. Known for his clean ball striking, he
  made an impact right from his T20I debut against India, smashing a quickfire
  44 off 26 balls. However, it was the 2021 T20 World Cup in the UAE where
  Asalanka truly stood out, scoring 231 runs at an average of 46.20 and a
  strike rate of 147.13, finishing as Sri Lanka’s top scorer in the
  tournament. 2025 has been a landmark year for Asalanka, with his appointment
  as Sri Lanka’s captain in both ODIs and T20Is. Alongside his crucial
  contributions with the bat, he also offers handy off-spin options. Now, he
  joins the Mumbai Indians as a replacement for Corbin Bosch at a reserve
  price of INR 75 lakhs. On spin-friendly surfaces, Asalanka could prove to be
  a valuable all-round asset as MI chase their sixth IPL title.
