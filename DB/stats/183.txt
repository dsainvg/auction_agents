BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    With an unorthodox bowling action reminiscent of his legendary countryman
  Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Thushara has that X-factor as a fast bowler. The Sri
  Lankan right-arm pacer carries a lot of T20 cricket experience and has also
  made a superb start to life in T20Is with 26 wickets from 18 games at an
  excellent average of 16.73. With the ability to trouble batters courtesy of
  a slingy action, Thushara was acquired by Mumbai Indians (MI) for INR 4.8
  Crore ahead of TATA IPL 2024 and was among the wickets more often than not
  in the games that he played. Now in the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB)
  set-up after being bought by them ahead of IPL 2025, Thushara is part of a
  star-studded fast-bowling line-up alongside the likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar,
  Josh Hazlewood, and Lungisani Ngidi.
