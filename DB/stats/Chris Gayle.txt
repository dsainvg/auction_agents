BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ‘Universe Boss’ Chris Gayle is the darling of the masses. There is no
  better entertainer than Gayle both on and off the field. After conquering
  the Bangalore crowds for RCB, Gayle made a quiet move to Punjab Kings in
  2018 and made an instant impact with another strong season that included a
  century against Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Gayle-Rahul combination is one of
  the most lethal in the tournament and the bowling sides have often struggled
  to contain the two as the left-right pair goes about their demolition job.
  Gayle had a fine season in 2019 where he was on the verge of getting his 7th
  IPL century but remained unbeaten on 99. He struck 4 half-centuries and
  scored a total of 490 runs from 319 balls that he faced. The lefthander had
  a similar outing in the 2020 season as he was dismissed once again for 99
  and missed out on a century. Although he added nearly 300 runs in the 7
  games that he played as an opener. Stay alert as there’s a “Gaylestorm”
  predicted in the 2021 season.
