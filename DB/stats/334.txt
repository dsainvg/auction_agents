BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A rising star from Mumbai’s cricketing ranks, Suryansh Shedge is a
  promising right-handed batter. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai in
  the 2023-24 Ranji Trophy season, scoring a gritty 99 against Tripura. He had
  already debuted in T20s during the 2024 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT),
  where his finishing prowess came to the fore. In the 2024-25 SMAT, Shedge
  turned heads with a string of match-winning cameos - 30* off 8 balls against
  Andhra, 36* off 12 against Vidarbha, and 36* off 15 in the final against
  Madhya Pradesh, amassing 131 runs at a staggering strike rate of 251.92 and
  picking up 8 wickets, helping Mumbai clinch the title. His ability to
  deliver under pressure caught the eye of PBKS, who saw him as a potential
  finisher and acquired his services for INR 30 Lakhs ahead of IPL 2025.
  Joining forces with Mumbai teammate and PBKS captain Shreyas Iyer, Shedge is
  poised to be a key part of the franchise and gain valuable insights from
  some of the greats of the game.
