BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    At 37 years of age, Imran Tahir became the World No.1 bowler in the
  shortest format of the game. His positivity and never-say-die attitude have
  been his success mantra all through these years, which is on display, every
  time he takes to the field. From his customary sprint, after he picks up a
  wicket to the roars, Tahir’s enthusiasm has kept him going. After
  representing Delhi Daredevils for two seasons, Tahir was included in the RPS
  squad for two seasons. The tenth edition of the league saw some
  match-winning performances by Tahir as he ended up picking 18 wickets in
  that season. Tahir is now all set to represent Chennai Super Kings.
