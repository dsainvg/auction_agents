BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    From joining RCB in TATA IPL 2022 as a replacement of the injured Luvnith
  Sisodia for the price of INR 20 Lakh to being handed the team’s captaincy,
  Rajat Patidar has come a long way. It was in the 2022 itself that Patidar
  played one of the most special knocks under pressure, smashing his way to
  112 off 54 balls against Lucknow Super Giants in the Eliminator. The
  right-handed batter, who represents Madhya Pradesh in domestic cricket, has
  continued to impress in the IPL and in domestic cricket since then with his
  highly consistent performances and has even represented India in Tests and
  ODIs. After leading Madhya Pradesh to the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20
  Trophy title in 2024, Patidar has now been given the responsibility of
  guiding RCB to their maiden TATA IPL title.
