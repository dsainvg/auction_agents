**Cameron Donald Green** (born 3 June 1999) is an Australian international cricketer who plays as an all-rounder for Australia and Western Australia. He is a right handed batter and right-arm fast-medium bowler. He was a member of the Australian team that won the 2023 Cricket World Cup and the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final.... ## Youth and domestic career

Green grew up in Subiaco, Perth and played for the Subiaco-Floreat Cricket Club. He started playing in the 2009–10 season in the under 13s league, when he was 10 years old. His rapid development meant he made his WACA first grade debut at the age of 16. Green earned a rookie contract with the Western Australian Cricket Association (WACA) ahead of the 2016/17 Sheffield Shield season, largely thanks to averaging 82 runs per innings and taking 20 wickets in eight games in the under 19s national league.... ### Sheffield Shield

He made his first-class debut for Western Australia in the 2016–17 Sheffield Shield season on 10 February 2017. He took 5/24 in the first innings to become the youngest player to take a five-wicket haul in the Sheffield Shield. He made his Twenty20 debut for the Perth Scorchers in the 2018–19 Big Bash League season on 13 January 2019.... Originally a bowling all-rounder, Green began focusing on improving his batting following a series of injuries, his breakthrough performance being 87* and 121* against Queensland in the 2019–20 Sheffield Shield season.

In March 2021, Green scored his maiden double century in first-class cricket, with 251 runs for Western Australia against Queensland in the 2020–21 Sheffield Shield season.... ### Indian Premier League

In the IPL 2023 auction, Green was bought by the Mumbai Indians for INR 17.5 crore (approximately $3.15 million AUD), making him the second-most expensive overseas player in IPL auction history, and the most expensive Australian. On 27 November 2023, soon after the deadline for the player retentions ahead of IPL 2024, he was traded to Royal Challengers Bangalore after representing the Mumbai Indians for one season.... ### English country cricket

In February 2025, Green signed a contract with Gloucestershire County Cricket Club to play in their first five county championship matches of the season. Green scored three centuries during the short stint.... ## International career

Green made his List A debut for Cricket Australia XI against Pakistan during their tour of Australia on 10 January 2017. In October 2020, Green was named in Australia's squad for the limited overs matches against India. In November 2020, he was also named in Australia's Test squad for the matches against India. Green made his One Day International (ODI) debut for Australia against India on 2 December 2020. In a warm-up match before the Test series, Green scored a century for Australia A. He made his Test debut for Australia on 17 December 2020, against India.... In February 2022, Green was named in Australia's Twenty20 International (T20I) squad for their tour of Pakistan. He made his T20I debut on 5 April 2022, for Australia against Pakistan. In August 2022, he took his first ODI five-wicket haul, against Zimbabwe in Townsville. In the first ODI against New Zealand in Cairns, he was named player of the match after making 89 not out in a difficult run chase. In the T20I Series against India, Green scored two half-centuries.... In October 2022, Green was added to the Australian squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup as an injury replacement for Josh Inglis.

In December 2022, Green picked up his maiden five-wicket haul in Test cricket while bowling in the first innings of the Boxing Day Test of the South Africa tour of Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.... In the fourth Test in Ahmedabad of the 2023 Border–Gavaskar Trophy, Green scored his maiden Test century (114).

On 28 September 2023 Green was included in Australia's squad for the 2023 ODI World Cup. On 8 October 2023, Green made his World Cup debut against India. On 3 November 2023, Green made his only other appearance of the tournament scoring a vital 47 off 52 to help Australia defeat England.... After Green fell out of favour from Test selection during the 2023 Ashes, he was dropped from the test side to face Pakistan. However, following David Warner's retirement, Green was reintroduced to the squad, climbing the batting order to play his natural position at number 4. He debuted in this position for the 2024 series against the West Indies.... This fresh start for Green paid dividends as he notched his second Test century against New Zealand on 29 February 2024 at the Basin Reserve. He finished the first day on 103* before putting on an impressive 116-run 10th wicket partnership with Josh Hazlewood, ending the 1st innings on 174*. This performance on an otherwise seam-friendly pitch earned Green a Player of the Match award.

In May 2024, he was named in Australia's squad for the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament.... ## Personal life

Green was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease before birth.
