Scores 30 batting first

**Batsman**Guyana Amazon Warriors

McDermott scored 30 off 18 balls with the help of three fours and two sixes for the Guyana Amazon Warriors during a four-wicket defeat to the St Lucia Kings in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) 2025 in Gros Islet on Tuesday.... **ANALYSIS**

McDermott had a decent day with the bat in hand. The right-hander scored a valuable 30 runs for the team but will be bitterly disappointed after failing to convert his start into something substantial. It was McDermott's fourth score of 30 or more in the seven innings in this year's CPL.... Batting Stats - Format
