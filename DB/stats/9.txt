BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Deepak Hooda made his Indian Premier League debut with the Rajasthan
  Royals. The youngster, who has established a reputation of being a powerful
  striker of the cricket ball, has been in the know for the Sunrisers of late.
  His gentle off-spinners and hard-hitting lower down the order has been
  recognised and the franchise sees some potential in the youngster. He has
  not quite set the stage on fire but he can be a handy all-rounder. Sunrisers
  over the years have trusted his abilities lower down the order and he played
  a similar role for PBKS in the 2020 season after being bought for INR 50
  lakh at the IPL auction. He has a reputation of successfully finishing the
  innings with the bat and can quickly help recover the team in case of early
  wickets. If he fires at the right time, the PBKS batting unit will be a
  settled one in the 2021 season.
