BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Winner of the 2018 IPL Purple Cap, Australian Andrew Tye was bought by
  Rajasthan Royals for INR 1 crore and then was retained ahead of the IPL
  2021. Tye has a mixed bag of variations and can confound opposition from all
  the franchises. Despite being a late bloomer, Tye was later roped in by the
  Australian T20 league and was considered to be the find of the tournament in
  2014. After making his debut in the IPL for Chennai Super Kings, Tye was
  also part of the Gujarat Lions and Kings XI Punjab (now Punjab Kings). The
  right-arm pacer has 40 IPL wickets to his name from 27 matches and he will
  be keen to add a few more scalps to his IPL wickets tally in the IPL 2021.
