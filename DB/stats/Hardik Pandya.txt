BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hardik Pandya began his IPL Career with Mumbai Indians where he spent
  seven seasons winning titles in 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020. He was picked by
  Gujarat Titans in 2022 and named captain. He started off with a bang,
  leading them to a title win in their very first season. He continued to
  display his leadership abilities in the team’s second season, guiding them
  to the final. Following two successful seasons with GT, Hardik moved to MI
  and was appointed captain. A terrific utility player Pandya can smash sixes
  at will and change the course of matches on his own. An impact player and a
  match-winner, Pandya has delivered crucial performances with the ball and
  can bowl in all the phases of the game. The Baroda all-rounder has been a
  vital cog for the Indian national team at the international stage both with
  the bat and the ball, playing several match-winning innings including some
  high-stakes performances during India’s triumph at the 2024 T20 World Cup
  and Champions Trophy 2025. His all-round abilities make him an asset across
  all formats and thus has been retained as MI’s captain for TATA IPL 2025.
