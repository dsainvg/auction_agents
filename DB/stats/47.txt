BIOGRAPHY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Vijay Shankar has been India’s go-to allrounder when Hardik Pandya was
  out of action for Team India. After making his debut in ODIs and T20Is for
  the national side, Shankar has only gone from strength to strength in his
  short stint with the Indian team. A handy bowler, with a strong batting
  technique and electric fielding capabilities, Shankar was a regular in the
  playing XI for the Sunrisers. He would be willing to put up more telling
  performances for his franchise this time around.
