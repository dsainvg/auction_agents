Given the player ${player_name} and your current team composition:
${team_composition}

Player stats:
${player_stats}

Using the system prompt rules and your budget, DECIDE whether to bid. Instead of returning text, CALL the `bidder_tool` with the appropriate arguments as described in the system prompt.

Guidance:
- `is_raise: true` to bid, `is_raise: false` to pass.
- If `is_raise` is true and you want a standard increment, set `is_normal: true`.
- If `is_raise` is true and you want a custom increment, set `is_normal: false` and provide `raised_amount`.
